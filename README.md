# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-OF-SENTIMENT140-DATASET-OF-1.6-MILLION-TWEETS-USING-XGBOOST-ALGORITHM
Project Assignment for Internship in Megaminds IT Services for the role of Python Development.

The objective of this sentiment analysis study is to develop an accurate and reliable model for classifying sentiment140 text data into sentiment categories.
By analyzing the sentiment expressed in the sentiment140 dataset, we aim to gain insights into the overall sentiment, identify positive or negative trends, and 
understand the sentiment distribution among different topics or entities.

An accuracy of 74.3% obtained using the XGBoost algorithm indicates that the model correctly predicted the sentiment of approximately 74.3% of the samples in the 
test data.
